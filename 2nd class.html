A smile is one of the cheapest things available in the world and probably it is almost effortless. But still, people do not share their valuable smile with the world and keep it for the special moments which they could enjoy. Perhaps they believe that a smile is only a means of self-enjoyment. If you are also one of them, then you are not aware of the powers of a positive smile beyond the means of self-enjoyment which can change your whole world and your whole surrounding. Itâ€™s a tool to establish peace and friendship around you.

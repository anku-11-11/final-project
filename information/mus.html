          <h1>Mussoorie Tourism</h1>
	      <h2>
If your idea of the perfect holiday involves tranquil hills, untouched nature and a holiday experience that is unadulterated in the truest sense of the term, Mussoorie is the place you should be heading to. Nestled amidst the foothills of the Garhwal Himalayan ranges, Mussoorie, also known as Queen of The Hills, stands at an altitude of 7000 feet above sea level, and has a cool, pleasant climate throughout the year. The pristine, natural beauty of Mussoorie makes it a very popular choice of holiday for honeymooners. If you want to enjoy the beautiful sight of the rolling green slopes juxtaposed with the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas, Mussoorie is the place for you to be.

This beautiful hill station is the perfect retreat from the sweltering weather of the plains, and the fact that it was a very popular holiday destination during the British era can be seen from the multitude of British remnants engulfing the city, such as the archaic architecture of the hotels and churches dotting the entire terrain. One of the most popular tourist attractions in Mussoorie is The Mall (also known as the Mall Road), which is a slightly steep boulevard that has eateries and other shops lining its entire stretch. From the little houses spread around the area to the architecture of even the lamp posts, The Mall gives off a distinct colonial vibe.</h2>

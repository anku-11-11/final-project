	<h1>What is the best time to visit Rishikesh?</h1>
<h2>The weather is good throughout the year, however Summers from May - June could be a bit warm. Summer is the peak season here as the white water rafting is most active during these months. It is also a favourite time because the yoga festival falls in March. Rishikesh is best visited during the winter season too, with a mild cold and crisp in the air making this pristine gateway of Himalayas be at it's best.</h2>

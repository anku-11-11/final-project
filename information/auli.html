<h1>What is the best time to visit Auli?</h1>
<h2>Auli is the kind of place that can be visited both in summers and winters. While the former is home to a pleasant climate, the latter receives you with a fairytale-like setting. So the best time to plan a trip to Auli is during April to June or in between October and February. If you are going specifically for skiing, then January-March is the time to go - that's when there are skiing festivals and championships all across the town. However, Auli is covered in the artificial snow all throughout the year and hence skiing can be enjoyed at any time of the year.</h2>
